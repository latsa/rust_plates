This repository contains some boilerplate projects meant to be
used as a starting point.

To build and run any of the projects, enter the corresponding directory and type
`cargo run`.

 - `bind_cabi` - a simple Rust project that uses a static library written in C.

 - `nanomsgrs_sample` - Same as above, except that it statically links to a third
   party library, named [nanomsg](https://github.com/thehydroimpulse/nanomsg.rs).

 - `nngrs_sample` - Same as above, except that it uses autogenerated bindings to
   link to the [nng](https://github.com/nanomsg/nng) librarty.
